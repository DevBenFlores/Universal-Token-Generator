    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Universal Token Generator Terms of Use</h1>
<blockquote><strong>NOTE</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>Universal Token Generator, its components (Smart
Contracts, UI, etc.), and the Site, are collectively referred to in
these Terms as the &quot;App&quot;, &quot;We&quot;, “Platform”.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Ethereum Network, the BNB Smart Chain, the Polygon
PoS Chain, and the Avalanche C-Chain, etc. are collectively referred
to in these Terms as the &quot;blockchain network&quot;.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The native coin of each network (ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX,
etc.) are collectively referred to in these Terms as the &quot;native
currency&quot;.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Data collected on a blockchain network or transactions
are public for its own nature. Any data stored in a blockchain
network may be accessible through other applications or exploring the
blockchain itself.</blockquote>
<hr/>

<h4 class="western">The App</h4>
<p>Universal Token Generator is a distributed application that runs
on a blockchain network using specially-developed Smart Contracts to
enable users to build their ERC20, BEP20, etc. Tokens.</p>
<p>To most easily use the App, you must first install a Web3 Wallet
(e.g. MetaMask). A Web3 Wallet is an electronic wallet, which allows
you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using native
currency on evm compatible blockchains. You will not be able to
engage in any transactions on the App other than through Web3
Wallets.</p>
<p>We neither own nor control Web3 Wallets, the blockchain network,
or any other third party site, product, or service that you might
access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the
various features of the App.</p>
<p>We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third
parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as
a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such
third parties.</p>
<p>Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed
via the blockchain. You understand that your public address will be
made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the
App.</p>
<h4 class="western">Fees and Payment</h4>
<p>If you elect to build a Token on the App, or with or from other
users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will
be conducted solely through the blockchain network via Web3 Wallets.</p>
<p>We will have no insight into or control over these payments or
transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse or refund any
transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or
to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a
result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using
the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via
the blockchain network or Web3 Wallet.</p>
<p>The blockchain network requires the payment of a transaction fee
(a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the blockchain
network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the
decentralized blockchain network. This means that you will need to
pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App. Gas Fee
depends on Gas Limit and on current Gas price average. Your Web3
Wallet will suggest both when you use the App. Do not decrease Gas
Limit to avoid transaction to fail. If you want, you can decrease Gas
Price but your transaction could remain pending for minutes/hours. Do
not send the same transaction multiple times. Duplicate or failed
transactions can't be refunded.</p>
<p>In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract
to conduct a transaction via the App, you authorize us to collect a
commission of an amount of native currency of the total value of that
transaction (each, a “Commission”). Commission will be publicly
visible on Web3 Wallet confirmation popup.</p>
<h4 class="western">Risks</h4>
<p>You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while
accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof.</p>
<p>The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.
Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially
and adversely affect the value of your Token, which may also be
subject to significant price volatility.</p>
<p>The App does not store, send, or receive your Token. This is
because your Token exists only by virtue of the ownership record
maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the blockchain
network. Any transfer of Token occurs within the supporting
blockchain in the blockchain network, and not on the App.</p>
<p>There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and
Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction,
and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge
that we will not be responsible for any communication failures,
disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when
using the blockchain network, however caused.</p>
<p>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
policies may materially adversely affect the development of the
Tokens ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of
your Token.</p>
<p>Upgrades by developers to the blockchain network, a hard fork in
the blockchain network, or a change in how transactions are confirmed
on the blockchain network may have unintended, adverse effects on all
blockchains using the ERC20/BEP20 etc. standard.</p>
<h4 class="western">External Sites</h4>
<p>The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources
(collectively, “External Sites”), which are provided solely as a
convenience to our users.</p>
<p>We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and
agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any
External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products
or other materials on or made available from any External Sites.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for
any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the
availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result
of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or
existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made
available from, any External Sites.</p>
<h4 class="western">Changes to the Terms</h4>
<p>We may make changes to the Terms from time to time.</p>
<p>Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to
the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your
continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been
updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or
use the App.</p>
<h4 class="western">Changes to the App</h4>
<p>We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best
possible experience. You acknowledge and agree that the form and
nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time
without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and
change any part of the App at any time without notice.</p>
